Linux Programming Notes
=======================

This project aims to organize my notes for the Linux Programming course by Jiangjiang Song.

## Organization

The notes are organized by chapters.

## References

The notes would reference two books:

* Beginning Linux Programming, 4th Edition
* Advanced Programming Unix Environment, 2nd Edition

**Disclaimer**: these documents are _never_ intended to be comprehensive and complete correct, although the author try his best to do so. If you find some error, don't hesitate to tell the author about it or just `fork` and `push`!
